            <h3>about me</h3>
            <p> Hey! I'm an aspiring Software Developer. I hold a degree in Computing Sciences from Jackosnville University, I have a solid understanding of computer science principles. 
                I have the technical skills for the work and also the people skills to leade others. I was President of the club soccer team. I managed the team and the administrative side of it.
                I am also an ROTC student and aspire to become a Marine Corps officer.
            </p>

            <p>Looking into the future my primary goal is to continue advancing my skills in emerging technologies in backend development and comssioning into the Marine Corps.
                I'd like to dive deeper into the AI aspect of things and new ways of solving bugs and creating more efficient program  with new technology. Integrating machine learning
                models into backend systems to provide more intelligent and data-driven features. Finally I'd like to work with more people learnig from other as well as mentoring those
                under my team to help everyone progress in their profession.
